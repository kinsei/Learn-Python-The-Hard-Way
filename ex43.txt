# This is exercise 43 from the book Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw

OOP Process:

1) write or draw the problem
2) extract key concepts from #1 and research them
3) create a class hierarchy and object map the concepts.
4) code the classes and test to rum them
5) repeat and refine

Analysis of game engine
    This will be a space adventure game called "Gothons from planet Percal
 #25". 

Write Draw problem
    Ailens have invaded the space ship and our hero has to go through a maze
of rooms defeating them so he can escape in an escape pod. The game will 
involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print
its own description when the player enters it then tells the engin what room to run next ou tof the map. 

Death: this is when the player dies and should ben something funny.
Central Corridor: this is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing
                  there, which the player has to defeat before continuing.
Laser Weapon Armory: this is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up
                     the ship before getting to the escape pod. it has to 
                     guess the number for.
The Bridge: another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.
Escape Pod: where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod.
