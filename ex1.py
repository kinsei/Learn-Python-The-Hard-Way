print "Hello World" #this prints a string
print "hello again" #this also prints a string
print "I like typing this" #this is a good exercise
print "this is fun"   #i should start putting comments into my code
print 'yay! printing' # i look forward to the next exercise
print "I'd much rather you 'not'"  # so I should take this seriously
print 'i "said" do not touch this'  #if you want to get better
