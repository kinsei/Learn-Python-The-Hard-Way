Rules for IF statement

1. Every If-statement must have an Else

2. If this Else should never be rum because is doesn't make sence, then you must use a die
   function in the Else that prints out an error message and dies.

3. Never nest If-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep. This means
   if you put an If in an If, then you  be looking to move that second if into another function.

4. Treat If-statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like a set of sentences.
   Put blank spaces before and after

5. Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables
   earlier in your function and use a good name for the variables.


Rules for Loops

1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to python;
   other languages are different.

2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, expecially if there is a fixed or limited number of
   things to loop over.
